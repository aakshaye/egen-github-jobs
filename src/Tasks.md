Let’s say you are part of a team that is working on developing a Job Board for the us. The idea is
to utilize GitHub Jobs API (https://jobs.github.com/api) for the data needs and develop a clean
responsive user interface with features:

1. View all the jobs that are currently live via the GitHub Jobs API.
2. Ability to search jobs based on location, title, company, skill, full-time role.
3. Ability to default the location to the user’s current geocoordinates.
4. Implement simple or infinite scroll for the pagination if there are more jobs and you
cannot fit them on single page.
5. View details of a specific job as provided in the designs.
6. Implement a responsive design that works with desktop and mobile browsers.
7. Implement a light and dark theme mode using a toggle button. Google prefers-color-
scheme in CSS, if you are new to it.
8. Commit your code to a private GitHub repository and deploy the site using the
netlify.com Starter (free) account.



Design Variables:
1. Light Theme: Purple: #5865E0, Light Gray: #F5F6F8, White: #FFFFFF
2. Dark Theme: Purple: #5865E0, Dark Blue: #131822, Light Blue: #19212D
3. Use any Font Icon library that you are familiar with.
Requirements:
1. Use any modern JavaScript framework (Angular, React, or Vue.JS), unless specified by
the recruiting team.
2. Try to get your end result as close as to the designs provided in the next pages.
3. Try to write some unit tests for your code. Use netlify to run unit tests before deploying.
4. Make sure you commit the code to your private GitHub repository. For the project
submission, just share the netlify URL of your site like: https://<your-repo>.netlify.app
For this exercise, make assumptions to the best of your understanding. If you are not be able to
complete all the requirements, that’s okay. We are hiring for many levels: Associate to Senior
level Engineers. So, give your best shot with the time you have. Give your imagination free rein.
All the best and we are excited to discuss your implementation in the interview.
